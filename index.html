						  			<h4>Blur / Sharpness</h4>
						  			<p>Going beyond standard MTF measurements to provide a perceptual measure of image sharpness, DxO Analyzer utilizes DxO's unique BxU (Blur eXperience Unit) to provide a meaningful measure of sharpness at twenty-five locations throughout the image. The resulting output sharpness map is an ideal for diagnosing optical alignment issues.</p>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>MTF (Horizontal &amp; Vertical)</h4>
						  			<p>DxO Analyzer includes a slanted-edge, "checkerboard", chart for measuring MTF in both horizontal and vertical directions, across the entire image field. The same test image can be used for measuring astigmatism, longitudinal chromatic aberrations, and ringing. In addition, the most recent version of DxO Analyzer software compensates for chart-limited MTF.</p>

						  	<div class="row">

Color shading, caused by many sources âˆ’ including IR filter or micro-lens array alignment or imperfections, sensor cross-talk, lens tilt or shift, or even sensor design -- is measured and characterized with a complete field map per color channel.</p>

						  	<div class="row">
						  		<div class="col-sm-7">
						  			<p class="intro">In tandem with the optics, the sensor, and the Image Signal Processing (ISP) in your device will determine overall image quality. DxO Analyzer's Photo Module provides the pieces you need to fully evaluate the quality of image capture and processing. By providing a full set of tests for texture details, noise, and sharpness, DxO Analyzer's Photo module allows you to make informed tradeoffs between them in your camera design âˆ’ especially how it handles low-light situations.</p>

						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Texture &amp; Acutance</h4>
						  			<p>One of the most important, and visible, measurements of image quality is the ability to accurately capture texture and edges. The Photo Module provides software and charts that provide Texture MTF and acutance, as well as Edge MTF and Acutance. Texture is measured using the provided reflective "dead leaves" chart that is IEEE-CPIQ compliant.</p>
						  			<img src="img/acutance.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="">
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Noise &amp; Contrast</h4>
						  			<p>One of the most important, and visible, measurements of image quality is the ability to accurately capture texture and edges. The Photo Module provides soft and graphics formaware and charts that provide Texture MTF and acutance, as well as Edge MTF and Acutance. Texture is measured using the provided reflective "dead leaves" chart that is IEEE-CPIQ compliant.</p>
						  			<p>Unique to DxO Analyzer is specialized HDR testing hardware that provides accurate contrast measurements âˆ’ including tonal ranges and tone curves âˆ’ up to 120dB (1,000,000:1) for testing your deviceâ€™s extended-dynamic-range capabilities. All individual density patches of our HDR chart are uniform, so no defocusing is required to get accurate results. ISO sensitivity can also be measured according to ISO standard #12232.</p>
						  		</div>
						  	</div>
						  	<div class="row">
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Tone Curve</h4>
						  			<p>By varying the illumination, the Photo Module provides a complete picture of the tonal response of your device. This is an excellent way to benchmark both the linearity of sensor response and gamma of the encoded JPEG.</p>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Row / Column noise</h4>
						  			<p>Stripe noise, either in rows or columns, is much more visible than random noise, so controlling it is very important in achieving an effective camera design. DxO Analyzer measures both row and column noise by performing frequency analysis in both dimensions âˆ’ charting the results and allowing you to easily spot issues.</p>
						  		</div>
						  	</div>
						  	<div class="row">
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Dead / Hot Pixels (Raw)</h4>
						  			<p>The Photo Module identifies both dead and hot pixels found in Raw image captures, so that you can gather quality statistics or map them out as needed.</p>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>ISO Sensitivity (compatible with ISO 12232)</h4>
						  			<p>The Photo Module measures and charts actual gain compared to changes in light levels, consistent with ISO standard 12232.</p>
						  		</div>
						  	</div>
						  	<div class="row">
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Color Sensitivity</h4>
						  			<p>By extending the notion of dynamic range to color, DxO Analyzer provides a measure of the color sensitivity of a sensor by calculating the total number of colors it can distinguish, subject to noise. The value is reported out as the number of bits required to encode all those colors.</p>

										</ul>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Color</h4>
						  			<p>The accuracy of your device's Auto White Balance (AWB) is automatically calculated using DxO's (optional) proprietary closed-loop lighting control system featuring a range of industry-standard illuminants with a standard ColorChecker chart. Once the white balance is calculated, color fidelity and Metamerism Index are also measured. The lighting system also makes it simple to measure color fidelity and sensitivity under a variety of lighting spectrum and illumination levels âˆ’ down to just a few Lux.</p>

						  			<p class="intro">Whether your device is an embedded imager or a standalone camera, the quality of its optics will play a major part in determining the quality of images it can capture. DxO Analyzer's Optics Module provides everything you need to fully characterize the performance of your Optics including testing both Raw and JPEG image capture.</p>

						  			<h4>Blur / Sharpness</h4>
						  			<p>Going beyond standard MTF measurements to provide a perceptual measure of image sharpness, DxO Analyzer utilizes DxO's unique BxU (Blur eXperience Unit) to provide a meaningful measure of sharpness at twenty-five locations throughout the image. The resulting output sharpness map is an ideal for diagnosing optical alignment issues.</p>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>MTF (Horizontal &amp; Vertical)</h4>
						  			<p>DxO Analyzer includes a slanted-edge, "checkerboard", chart for measuring MTF in both horizontal and vertical directions, across the entire image field. The same test image can be used for measuring astigmatism, longitudinal chromatic aberrations, and ringing. In addition, the most recent version of DxO Analyzer software compensates for chart-limited MTF.</p>

						  	<div class="row">
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>MTF (Radial)</h4>
						  			<p>n addition to traditional horizontal and vertical MTF test charts, DxO Analyzer includes an IEEE-CPIQ and ISO 12233-compliant low-contrast chart for measuring radial MTF. These test charts are also calibrated with DxO Analyzer software.</p>
						  		</div>
						  		<div class="col-sm-6">
						  			<h4>Ringing &amp; Color Fringing</h4>
						  			<p>Using edge profiles on its ISO #12233-compliant MTF chart, the Optics Module measures ringing artifacts to help you evaluate and tune your sharpening algorithms. The Optics Module also includes a custom Color Fringing transmissive chart that provides measurements of color inaccuracies caused by chromatic aberration âˆ’ that are especially visible in highly saturated areas.</p>

						  			<h4>Vignetting (Luminance &amp; Color Shading)</h4>
						  			<p>Making use of the same dot chart images, vignetting is measured by channel for both the Raw data (where available) and the finished RGB image, under a variety of lighting conditions. Color shading, caused by many sources âˆ’ including IR filter or micro-lens array alignment or imperfections, sensor cross-talk, lens tilt or shift, or even sensor design -- is measured and characterized with a complete field map per color channel.</p>
